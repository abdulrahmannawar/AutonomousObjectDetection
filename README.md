# Autonomous Object Detection

## This project was part of a module at university named: "Systems Development Group Project"

### The purpose of this project is to train an object detector for cones in RGB images for racing tracks, outputting a bounding box and class label for all cones in the image, using the publicly available dataset that contain cones of the Formula Student design, the FSOCO dataset, trainging an object detector model and evaluating its accuracy and speed of classification.
